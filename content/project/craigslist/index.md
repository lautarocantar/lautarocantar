**Role**: Data analyst and R developer

Craigslist.org is a large source of information for many different items, but especially, for rental housing. At BARI and TACC, I built an infrastructure to collect, store, and share this information for all rental housing in the state of Massachusetts. This information has the potential to provide a deeper analysis of the rental market and, thus, change or redirect some public policies about affordable housing.
