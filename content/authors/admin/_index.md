I am currently working as a Data Analyst at the [Ministry of the Interior, Public Works, and Housing](www.argentina.gob.ar/interior). Previously I worked at [Modernization Secretariat under the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers](www.datos.gob.ar), the Boston Area Research Initiative and The American City Coalition. I received my MS in Urban Informatics from Northeastern University (Boston, MA) and my BA in Economics from Universidad Nacional de La Plata.

My current work and research interests stand in the application of data science tools for making public policy decisions: how can we help policymakers make better public policies? I am also interested in data automatization, data visualization, data literacy and, basically, anything related to data!

Here you will find the projects I'm working or worked on as well as blog posts with tutorials or thoughts. Post can be either in  Spanish (mostly) or English.
